            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; color: #003366;">About</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">Hi there! My name is John Reniel D. Balsacao, and I’m a 19-year-old BSIT student at Carlos Hilado Memorial State University, currently based in Bacolod City. I was born on November 2, 2005, in Sagay City, and I now live in a boarding house in Brgy. Alijis while studying at my university.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">Although my academic focus is on Information Technology, where I am learning a variety of programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, C, and more, my passions extend far beyond the world of code. I’ve always had a strong love for the arts, and it has been a part of me for as long as I can remember. Whether it’s drawing, painting, or other forms of creative expression, I find peace and inspiration through my artistic side.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">Alongside my academic and artistic pursuits, I have a deep love for music, especially playing the guitar. Music has been a huge part of my life, offering a creative outlet and a way to express my thoughts and emotions. I enjoy experimenting with different melodies and chords during my free time, and it often serves as a way to unwind after a busy day of coding and studying.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">As I navigate my way through the path of becoming an IT professional, I’m constantly exploring new technologies, tools, and frameworks that allow me to expand my skills. I find it fascinating how technology can shape our world, and I’m eager to be a part of that evolution. But what truly excites me is the potential to combine my love for art and technology. Whether it’s through web development, game design, or creative coding, I aim to use my skills to create digital experiences that are both functional and visually engaging.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">When I’m not studying, coding, or playing music, you can find me spending time with friends, exploring new hobbies, or simply reflecting on ways to grow both personally and professionally. The journey ahead is exciting, and I can’t wait to see where my passion for IT and art will take me.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; color: #003366;">My Vision</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">As a student of technology with a passion for the arts, my vision is to explore and merge the worlds of art and technology. I firmly believe that the two are not separate but are complementary, and when combined, they have the power to create impactful and meaningful experiences. I want to contribute to a future where technology doesn’t just solve problems but also engages the heart and mind through creativity and design.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">In the coming years, I see myself working on projects that not only push the boundaries of technology but also incorporate aesthetic beauty and intuitive design. Whether through web development, app design, or interactive media, I want to focus on creating products that are both functional and visually captivating. My goal is to develop digital solutions that are accessible, engaging, and enjoyable to use, ensuring a seamless blend of form and function.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">I envision a future where I work on impactful technologies, such as educational tools, healthcare applications, and sustainable solutions that can make a real difference in people's lives. These are areas where technology can offer tangible benefits, and I aspire to contribute to projects that solve real-world problems while maintaining a focus on user-centered design. My goal is to help shape technology in ways that make it more accessible, efficient, and impactful.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">In addition to technical development, I am passionate about user experience (UX) and interface design. I believe that the success of a product lies not only in its technical performance but also in how it feels and interacts with users. I envision a future where I can create digital environments that are visually engaging, easy to navigate, and provide a satisfying experience for every user. My aim is to become an expert in blending technology with artistry to produce digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">Ultimately, my vision is to use my skills to create a positive impact in the world. I am committed to exploring innovative ways to connect people, improve their lives, and enhance their daily experiences through technology. By combining my technical skills with my love for the arts, I aspire to build a future where technology becomes not just a tool, but a canvas for creativity, innovation, and meaningful change.</p>

I aim to combine technical excellence with creative problem-solving to address the evolving challenges in the tech industry.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">Looking ahead, I plan to further my education, learn more about machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies that are shaping the future of the industry. I am also interested in pursuing opportunities that will allow me to work on impactful projects—whether in web development, mobile apps, or game design—that challenge me and push me to think outside the box. My goal is to not just be a programmer, but to become a versatile technologist who can contribute meaningfully to the digital world.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555;">On a personal level, I also aim to continue fostering my passion for art and music. I believe that maintaining a balance between my technical pursuits and my artistic interests will help me stay inspired and innovative. By applying creativity to my projects, I hope to produce work that is both functional and visually engaging, helping me stand out in the industry.</p>
